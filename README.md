# IPL Dashboard
A dashboard to view all the teams and matches details of IPL right from the beginning to 2020.

<br/>
<br/>

Dataset was present on kaggle in csv format. Converted csv data to In-App HyperSQL Database by scripting in Spring Batch. Made API using Spring Boot to serve the data in JSON objects. Frontend is made using React JS calling the API and presenting in the way we can see in snapshots below. Deployed this on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
